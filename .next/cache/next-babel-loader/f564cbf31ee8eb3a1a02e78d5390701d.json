<h4>Progress of goal 3 in 2019</h4>\n            <p>\n              Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions\n              of people, increasing life expectancy, reducing maternal and child\n              mortality and fighting against leading communicable diseases.\n              However, progress has stalled or is not happening fast enough with\n              regard to addressing major diseases, such as malaria and\n              tuberculosis, while at least half the global population does not\n              have access to essential health services and many of those who do\n              suffer undue financial hardship, potentially pushing them into\n              extreme poverty. Concerted efforts are required to achieve\n              universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health, to\n              address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, including\n              mental health, and to tackle antimicrobial resistance and\n              determinants of health such as air pollution and inadequate water\n              and sanitation.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"italic\">Infectious diseases</p>\n            <ul className=\"content-list\">\n              <li>\n                An estimated 303,000 women around the world died due to\n                complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2015. Almost all of\n                these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and\n                almost two thirds of those were in sub-Saharan Africa. These\n                deaths are preventable with appropriate management and care.\n                Globally in 2018, 81 per cent of births took place with the\n                assistance of a skilled birth attendant, a significant\n                improvement from 69 per cent in 2012. Coverage of skilled birth\n                attendants in 2018 was only 59 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                he under-5 mortality rate fell to 39 deaths per 1,000 live\n                births in 2017, a 6.7 per cent reduction from 42 deaths in 2015,\n                and an overall reduction of 49 per cent from 77 deaths per 1,000\n                live births in 2000. The total number of under-5 deaths dropped\n                to 5.4 million in 2017 from 9.8 million in 2000. Still, most of\n                these deaths were from preventable causes and almost half, or\n                2.5 million, occurred in the first month of life – the most\n                crucial period for child survival. The global neonatal mortality\n                rate has continued to decline after a long downward trend from\n                31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 18 in 2017, a 41 per\n                cent reduction.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                mmunization saves millions of lives and is widely recognized as\n                one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health\n                interventions. Coverage of the required three doses of the\n                vaccine that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis\n                increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 and\n                has remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 19.9\n                million children did not receive the vaccines during the first\n                year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially\n                fatal diseases. The global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate\n                vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce deaths\n                in children under age of 5, has yet to reach 50 per cent. Two\n                doses of the measles vaccine are required to prevent the disease\n                and the illnesses, disabilities and deaths caused by\n                complications associated with it. Coverage with the second dose\n                of measles vaccine increased from 59 per cent in 2015 to 67 per\n                cent in 2017, but that is still insufficient to prevent this\n                highly contagious disease.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Expanding access to modern contraceptive methods is essential to\n                ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care\n                services. Globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age\n                (15 to 49 years old) who have their need for family planning\n                satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has continued to\n                increase slowly, from 74 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in\n                2019.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Adolescent fertility declined from 56 births per 1,000\n                adolescent women in 2000 to 45 births in 2015 and 44 births in\n                2019. The level of adolescent fertility has remained high in\n                sub-Saharan Africa, at 101 births per 1,000 adolescent women.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n      </TabsDark>\n    </main>\n    <FooterV2 />\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default PageGoalDetail;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
